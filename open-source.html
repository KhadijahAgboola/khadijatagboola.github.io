  <p>Prior to now, I have always loved to contribute to open  source. This was one of the motivating factors for applying to <b>Outreachy</b>. When I officially joined the contribution period for the June 2025 internship round, I contributed to the Fedora Project: Create DEI event organization documentation, coordinate marketing and DEI local communities.</p>
  <p>I discovered <b>Fedora</b> is a global community passionate about building and sharing free software, something that deeply aligns with my own values. Fedora’s strong culture of collaboration, especially with upstream projects, excites me.</p>

  <h3>Issue #10: Create a High-Level Timeline for Your Outreachy Internship</h3>
  <p>
    I completed <a href="https://gitlab.com/fedora/dei/outreachy-internship/-/issues/10#note_2442896767" target="_blank">Issue #10</a>.
    I created a high-level timeline of what I plan to achieve during the internship period, breaking it down into three main phases:
    <strong>Days 1–30</strong>, <strong>Days 31–60</strong>, and <strong>Days 61–90</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This structure helps me stay focused and organized throughout the internship. Each phase outlines specific goals—from onboarding and documentation review to community engagement and final wrap-up—ensuring I make steady progress and deliver meaningful contributions over the three months.
