    <h1>Tata Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights Job Simulation on Forage - October 2023</h1>
    <h2><strong>Task 1</strong></h2>
    <p>A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and you need to draft the relevant analytics and
    insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make
    the decision on expansion.</p>
    <h2><stong>Solution</stong></h2>
    <h3><strong>Questions of interest to a CEO</strong></h3>
    <ol>1. Which region is generating the highest revenue, and which region is generating the lowest?</br>
        2. What is the monthly trend of revenue, which months have faced the biggest increase/decrease?</br>
        3. Which months generated the most revenue? Is there a seasonality in sales?</br>
        4. Who are the top customers and how much do they contribute to the total revenue? Is the business dependent on these
        customers or is the customer base diversified?
    </ol>
    <h3><strong>Questions of interest to a CMO</strong></h3>
    <ol>1. What is the percentage of customers who are repeating their orders? Are they ordering the same products or different?</br>
    2. For the repeat customers, how long does it take for them to place the next order after being delivered the previous
    one?</br>
    3. What revenue is being generated from the customers who have ordered more than once?</br>
    4. Who are the customers that have repeated the most? How much are they contributing to revenue?
    </ol></br>
   <h2><strong>Task 2</strong></h2>
    <p>In this task, I created the visuals around four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested using Power Bi</p>
    <h3><strong>Question 1</strong></h3>
    <p>The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would
    like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends
    and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next
    year.</p></br>
    <a href="images/Question 1.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/Question 1.png" alt="" /></a></br></br>
    <h3><strong>Question 2</strong></h3>
    <p>The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is
    also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United
    Kingdom in this visual.</p></br>
    <a href="images/Question 2.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/Question 2.png" alt="" /></a></br></br>
    <h3><strong>Question 3</strong></h3>
    <p>The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in
    a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue
    generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain
    satisfied with their products.</p></br>
    <a href="images/Question 3.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/Question 3.png" alt="" /></a></br></br>
    <h3><strong>Question 4</strong></h3>
    <p>The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which
    regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he
    will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from
    these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data
    points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in
    viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.</p></br>

    <h2><strong>Task 3</strong></h2>
    <h3><strong>Presenting Findings to Stakeholders</strong></h3>
    I’m excited to share some insights about your business. Thank you for
    providing the guiding questions. It was helpful to see what types of insights you are looking to
    gain from the data. I hope you find the analysis compelling and helpful as you make decisions
    regarding future business opportunities.</br></br>
    
    I want to assure you that I’ve provided the most up to date and error free analysis. After
    I loaded the data into my software, I removed any records that have negative quantities and
    unit price, as these records needed to be removed in order to provide helpful analysis.</br></br>
    
    As for your first question, the CEO has requested a trend of the revenue to see if there is any
    seasonality in the store sales. My analysis shows that there are some months of the year where
    exceptional growth is witnessed. The data shows that the revenue in the first 8 months is fairly
    constant as the average revenue generated for these 8 months is around $685k. The increase
    in revenue starts in the month of September, where the revenue increases by 40% over the
    previous month. This trend continues till the month of November where it reached 1.5 million
    USD, the highest during the entire year. The data is incomplete for the month of December,
    therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from it, unfortunately. This analysis shows that the retail
    store sales are impacted by the seasonality which usually occurs in the last 4 months of the
    year.</br></br>
    
    The second visual shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are
    performing. This data does not include the UK as the country already has high demand and I’ve
    been told you’re more focused on the countries where demand can be increased. The analysis
    shows that countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France have high volumes
    of units bought and revenue generated. I would suggest that these countries should be focused
    on to ensure that measures are taken to capture these markets even more.</br></br>
    
    The third analysis has been performed on the top 10 customers who have purchased the most
    from the store. The data shows that there is not much of a difference between the purchases
    made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue generating customer only purchased 17%
    more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers
    to generate the revenue. This shows that the bargaining power of customers is low and the
    business is in a good position.</br></br>
    
    Finally, the map chart shows the regions that have generated the most revenue compared with
    the regions that have not. It can be seen that apart from the UK, countries such as Netherlands,
    Ireland, Germany, France and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should
    invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. The map also shows that most of
    the sales are only in the European region with very few in the American region. Africa and Asia
    do not have any demand for the products, along with Russia. A new strategy targeting these
    areas have the potential to boost sales revenues and profitability.
